    "BlazingText provides extended Word2Vec algorithm used for generating dense vector representations of words in large corpora using unsupervised learning. The resulting vectors have been shown to capture semantic relationships between the corresponding words and are used extensively for many downstream natural language processing (NLP) tasks like sentiment analysis, named entity recognition and machine translation.  Moreover, it supports Out-of-vocabulary (OOV) to predict words that are not in training dataset with much higher performance than FastText.   With supervised training dataset with labels, it also supports Text Classification to organize and categorize scientific terms."
